A Command-Line Interface Wrapper to Easily Use Youtube-DL in Single and Batch Methods

Goals of this project:
- Simple Directory Traversing
- Use Only Native Python Available Libs

- Completely Open Source, feel free to take it, modify it, learn from it, etc. 

Work To Be Done:
- Multi-threading for batch processing
- Add Custom features - rename a file upon pulling, resolution changes, format changes, save a config file for next time, etc. 
- Windows Command Calls - WIP at the moment
- Work with other shells (as needed)
- Better Error Handling in certain areas (batch processing)
- Work with other websites as well - where possible

Requirements:
